"""The eval runner: fan episodes out with bounded concurrency.

Rollouts run through the env-server worker pool by default (`[serve]` sizes it;
elastic — one worker, scaling on demand), the same path prime-rl trains through.
`--no-serve` runs them in-process instead. Both paths share this runner — task
selection, resume, persistence, the dashboard — and differ only in how one slot
becomes one episode: `env.run_slot` in-process, a `run` request to the pool
otherwise. The dashboard watches the same `RunSlot`s either way; a served slot
has no live traces, so its per-turn detail lands when the episode completes.
